      <h1>To The Love of My Life</h1>

      <p>Isaac, you will always be the cookies to my cream, the rice to my sushi, and the passionfruit to my iced tea.</p>
      <p>I promised I’ll always be right by your side, always loving you and supporting you because you’re the only guy I wanna do life with. That is, and will always be true.</p>
      <p>I thought I knew what my favorite 2 colors were, but that was until I saw your beautiful hazel eyes; the ones I could get lost in for hours.</p>
      <p>I don’t wanna spend a second without you; I adore you endlessly and I can't wait to be with you for the rest of my life, beary bear.</p>

<h2>Favorite Memories</h2>

<p>The time you asked about the scars on my thigh, made jokes to lighten up the mood, and then showed me yours; which I loved kissing.</p>
<p>Carrying me out of the car so I could see the view on the mountain, holding me close on the bench and kissing me, bringing me to your room because I didn't want to be away from you for a single second and in the hallway as you were running.</p>
<p>When we went into the servo and you had your arm wrapped around me as we looked for drinks to get, one of them being the ginger bev that you love.</p>
<p>Telling me that you already had baby wipes packed after asking me what snacks I liked, and how I didn't want anything messy.</p>
<p>Kissing me and licking off the yogurt and Cheeto dust from my lips on your kitchen counter.</p>
<p>Sitting me down and shaving my legs in the washroom and kissing me all over </p>
<p>Your "I love you's", and holding my hands every single time we make love.</p>
<p>Kissing every part of my body to make me feel safe.</p>
<p>Eating Wendy's, getting beef chili because you know how much I love spicy food, feeding fries to one another, and kissing with a mouthful of food while laughing.</p>
<p>My legs in your lap as you drive.</p>
<p>Pulling me to the side, looking into my eyes, reassuring me and calming me down gently when I was overthinking our beach day.</p>
<p>Climbing up the rocks because you wanted me to take my pictures and make me happy.</p>
<p>Pushing me around in your chair, sitting down and drinking breezers</p>
<p>Putting your whole body weight on top of me and running away when I tickled you too much.</p>
<p>Kissing the sunburn on your arm, and rubbing your chest when you were coughing.</p>
<p>Laughing together at how long I took to change and wiping your sweat with a towel.</p>
<p>Staying up all night with me playing roblox despite being extremely sleepy.</p>
<p>Caressing my thighs and paying attention to every detail on my leg. </p>
<p>Always walking me home to make me feel safer. </p>
<p>Helping me get up and down the rocks at the beach. </p>
<p>Getting me an apple flavored drink, thinking it was litchi, after I mentioned liking the fruit only once. </p>
<p>Wrapping my legs around you as you spin me around in the water and gaze into my eyes.</p>
<p>Always carrying a powerbank for me because you notice how I always forget to charge my phone.</p>
<p>Drinking a pineapple flavored monster and singing metal songs together.</p>
<p>Hugging me, comforting me, and wiping my tears when I was crying because of how happy and in love I am with you, and blowing my nose with your shorts.</p>
<p>Sitting in your lap as you drive, giving you kissess all over, admiring your beautiful eyes, and having people watch us (yes, they were definitely jealous).</p>
<p>Carrying my backpack all the way to timmies and back.</p>
<p>Rating eachother's burps.</p>
<p>Always letting me pick the songs on our car rides</p>
<p>Picking me up after a long day of work during rush hour and still being so attentive, patient, and caring.</p>
<p>Talking about how in love with me you are and appreciating me as I slept on call.</p>
<p>Watching Mr.Bean together.</p>
<p>Holding my hand to guide me everywhere and holding a sushi platter all the way to your place.</p>
<p>Moving me away from the road before crossing, and placing yourself closest to it.</p>







      




      

    
      

      

      <h2>Your Signature Moves</h2>
      <ul class="reminders">
        <li>Sassy eye rolls.</li>
        <li>Grumpy, sleepy expressions; right off the wake up.</li>
        <li>Pretending not to be tired then falling asleep on your chair 5 minutes later.</li>
        <li>Playing an imaginary guitar, and drums when listening to music.</li>
        <li>Your excuse me's after every yawn.</li>
        <li>Twirly wirly—need I say more?</li>
        <li>Stimming when you find something cute.</li>
        <li>Bopping your head when you laugh.</li>
        <li>Sticking your tongue out before saying something offensive.</li>
        <li>Scrunching your nose when you disagree with me.</li>
        <li>The way you say "huh" or "must've been the birds", when pretending not to have said something.</li>
        <li>"Good burp."</li>

      <h2>Poetry For You</h2>
      <div class="poem">
        <strong>Time</strong><br>
        Eyes illuminating like a sunset in the summer<br>
        Messy curly hair; a talented former drummer<br>
        Amorous stares, those I could never give to another<br>
       A million years could pass, to me he's the perfect lover<br><br>

        <strong>Tranquility</strong><br>
        Wrapped around your arms, I sleep and feel serene<br>
        Looking up at your smile, the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen<br>
        Every moment we’ve had is straight out of a dream<br>
        My heart will never be the same, you beautifully tore it at the seam

        <strong>Intimacy</strong><br>
        Hand-in-hand, never letting go<br>
        You're the only one with whom I'd rather grow old<br>
        With every glance you give me, you light up my world<br>
        Your voice is so calming; akin to the call of a cuckoo bird<br>
      </div>

      <p id="heartMsg">I keep this here to remind you that even when I’m not around, my heart still is.</p>
