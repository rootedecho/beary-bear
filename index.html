      <h1>To The Love of My Life</h1>

      <p>Isaac, you will always be the cookies to my cream, the rice to my sushi, and the passionfruit to my iced tea.</p>
      <p>I promised I’ll always be right by your side, always loving you and supporting you because you’re the only guy I wanna do life with. That is, and will always be true.</p>
      <p>I thought I knew what my favorite 2 colors were, but that was until I saw your beautiful hazel eyes; the ones I could get lost in for hours.</p>
      <p>I don’t wanna spend a second without you; I adore you endlessly and I can't wait to be with you for the rest of my life, beary bear.</p>

<h2>Favorite Memories</h2>

<p>The time you asked about the scars on my thigh, made jokes to lighten up the mood, and then showed me yours; which I loved kissing.</p>
<p>Carrying me out of the car so I could see the view on the mountain, holding me close on the bench and kissing me, bringing me to your room because I didn't want to be away from you for a single second and in the hallway as you were running.</p>
<p>Telling me that you already had wipes packed after asking me what snacks I liked, and how I didn't want anything messy.</p>
<p>Kissing me and licking off the yogurt and Cheeto dust from my lips on your kitchen counter.</p>
<p>Sitting me down and shaving my legs in the washroom and kissing me all over </p>
<p>Your "I love you's", and holding my hands every single time we make love.</p>
<p>Kissing every part of my body to make me feel safe.</p>
<p>Eating Wendy's, getting beef chili because you know how much I love spicy food, feeding fries to one another, and kissing with a mouthful of food while laughing.</p>
<p>My legs in your lap as you drive.</p>
<p>Pulling me to the side, looking into my eyes, reassuring me and calming me down gently when I was overthinking our beach day.</p>
<p>Climbing up the rocks because you wanted me to take my pictures and make me happy.</p>
<p>Pushing me around in your chair, sitting down and drinking breezers</p>
<p>Putting your whole body weight on top of me and running away when I tickled you too much.</p>
<p>Kissing the sunburn on your arm, and rubbing your chest when you were coughing.</p>
<p>Laughing together at how long I took to change and wiping your sweat with a towel.</p>
<p>Staying up all night with me playing roblox despite being extremely sleepy.</p>
<p>Caressing my thighs and paying attention to every detail on my leg. </p>
<p>Always walking me home to make me feel safer. </p>
<p>Getting me an apple flavored drink, thinking it was litchi, after I mentioned liking the fruit only once. </p>
<p>Wrapping my legs around you as you spin me around in the water and gaze into my eyes.</p>
<p>Always carrying a powerbank for me because you notice how I always forget to charge my phone.</p>
<p>Drinking a pineapple flavored monster and singing metal songs together.</p>
<p>Hugging me, comforting me, and wiping my tears when I was crying because of how happy and in love I am with you, and blowing my nose with your shorts.</p>
<p>Sitting in your lap as you drive, giving you kissess all over, admiring your beautiful eyes, and having people watch us (yes, they were definitely jealous).</p>
<p>Carrying my backpack all the way to timmies and back.</p>
<p>Rating eachother's burps.</p>
<p>Picking me up after a long day of work during rush hour, and still being so attentive, patient, and caring.</p>
<p>Talking about how in love with me you are and appreciating me. as I slept on call.</p>
<p>Watching Mr.Bean together.</p>
<p>Holding my hand to guide me everywhere and carrying a sushi platter all the way to your place.</p>
<p>Moving me away from the road before crossing, and placing yourself closest to it.</p>
<p>Giving me the tightest hug when you saw me, and not letting me go; walk-carrying me to the car.</p>
<p>Making sure I have my seatbelt on, focusing more on driving, and apologizing if you brake too hard or hit a bumpy road.</p>
<p>Adding rocca in a wrap you made me, even though I didn't want veggies, just so I could get some fiber in.</p>
<p>Doing things such as wrapping me in your arms, holding me tight, and overall shifting the focus from you to me to make sure I feel loved, even when my feelings are unclear.</p>
<p>Feeding me pods for the second time; your favorite snack ever.</p>
<p>"Outside light"</p>
<p>Giving you a massage and kissing your head, as you rest on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Listening to music as we gaze into eachother's eyes.</p>
<p>Loving eachother all while experiencing nausea and fevers.</p>

<p>Choosing my favorite snacks without me having to say a word.</p>
<p>Picking me up in the parking lot and walking to the staircase.</p>
<p>Cutting up fruit for you, topless.</p>
<p>Hearing you snore as we slept in eachother's arms.</p>
<p>Choosing my favorite snacks without me having to say a word.</p>Parking at the beach and snuggling up in our hoodies together.</p>

      <h2>Poetry For You</h2>
      <div class="poem">
        <strong>Time</strong><br>
        Eyes illuminating like a sunset in the summer<br>
        Messy curly hair; a talented former drummer<br>
        Amorous stares, those I could never give to another<br>
       A million years could pass, to me he's the perfect lover<br><br>

        <strong>Tranquility</strong><br>
        Wrapped around your arms, I sleep and feel serene<br>
        Looking up at your smile, the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen<br>
        Every moment we’ve had is straight out of a dream<br>
        My heart will never be the same, you beautifully tore it at the seam

        <strong>Intimacy</strong><br>
        Hand-in-hand, never letting go<br>
        You're the only one with whom I'd rather grow old<br>
        With every glance you give me, you light up my world<br>
        Your voice is so calming; akin to the call of a cuckoo bird<br>
